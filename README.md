# Saama Tech Examplary Project

Problem Statement: 
Given a small real Electronic Health Record (EHR) table (demographics, vitals, labs) and you can choose any dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository. Select any tabular-data synthesis framework or library, fit a generative model to the real data, sample 1,000 synthetic patient records. For evaluation, compute column-wise statistical test and a privacy metric such as PCA-based distance between real and
synthetic data or record-matching risk.
Deliverable:
A script that shows your framework choice, model training code, sampling code, and
evaluation results, with short writing on synthesized data quality and privacy trade-offs.

Execution:
Chose Thyroid Disease dataset from Garavan Institute (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/102/thyroid+disease). Opted for new-thyroid.[data, names] set use for synthesis (no missing values, data pre-cleaned, contains diagnosis label for later classification if needed, moderate size).
